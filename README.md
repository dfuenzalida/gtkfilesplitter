Gtk File Splitter
=================

GtkFileSplitter is a simple desktop application made to split files in smaller pieces, and to join file pieces to form the original files; its similar to other programs such as Hacha (Axe) or HJSplit.

Thanks to volunteers, it has language support for Czech, Dutch, French, Hebrew, Italian, Polish, Simplified Chinese, Spanish and Swedish.

It requires Python, GTK and Glade, which come with default install on several Linux distros (ie. Ubuntu), but can even run on Microsoft Windows (with GTK and Python installed).

Install as an Ubuntu package
------------

You can add my Ubuntu PPA to your software sources and install this program from the Ubuntu Software Center.
